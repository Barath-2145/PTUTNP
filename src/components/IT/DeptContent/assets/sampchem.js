      "Introduction": "The Department of Chemical Engineering since its inclusion in 1998 has a vision to be a dynamic department, with cohesive and exciting academic programs that define continuously the future of the chemical industries. This department is one among the six chemical engineering departments in Government/Government aided sector in this region of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The department building has a sprawling floor area of 2000 square meters, houses 3 class rooms, a departmental library, independent faculty rooms and 8 laboratories. The department offers B.Tech. course in ‘Chemical Engineering’ with an annual intake of 30 students in the first year and 5 students in second year through lateral entry scheme. The department jointly with department of civil engineering also offers an M.Tech. course in ‘Environmental Engineering’. The department is steered to achieve the pinnacle of excellence by a team of highly qualified and dedicated faculty members whose areas of specialization include petroleum and petrochemicals, process control and simulation, energy technology, process engineering and design. To further the pursuit of excellence, the department fosters an intellectually vibrant, collegial atmosphere with keen appreciation of the values of diversity among our students, staff and faculty, and breadth in research endeavors.",

          "An active student’s forum ‘ACES’ (Association of Chemical Engineering Students) frequently arranges lectures by experts from industry and academia. A national level student's technical symposium — TIELINES is conducted once in three years. In addition, students are also encouraged to participate in several technical meets conducted by other institutions all over India. Students have brought laurels to the department by securing top positions in these meets. The department, in addition to educational tours, also organizes regular field/industrial visits. Some of the industries visited by the department include CPCL, South India Viscose, Grasim Cements, EID Parry, Auro Foods, etc. The ACES also organizes a number of personality development programs forth students."
