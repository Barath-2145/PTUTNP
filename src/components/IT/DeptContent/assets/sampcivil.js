      "Introduction": "The Department of Civil Engineering was established during the inception of the college. Apart from offering B.Tech. in Civil Engineering, two M.Tech. programs, Structural Engineering and Environmental Engineering and Ph.D. in civil engineering are offered. The major strength of this department is its faculty. Highly qualified, experienced and committed faculty members significantly contribute to the growth of the college in general and this department in particular. Students are offered world class training both in theory and practice. Industrial training is part of the curriculum both for UG and PG students. The Department has been accredited by the National Board of Accreditation of AICTE, New Delhi and the U.G. programme (B.Tech. - Civil Engineering) has been awarded an ’A’ grade for Five years.",
