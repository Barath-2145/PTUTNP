      "Introduction": "The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, since its inception in the year 1985, has been producing globally competitive engineering graduates with benchmark domain expertise and all-round finesse. The Department is resourceful in terms of infrastructure and state-of-the-art facilities to pursue academic education and research in niche areas of technology. Liberal funding from the Government of Puducherry and reputed research departments has enabled the Department to acquire specialized research facilities. The highly qualified and experienced faculty in adequate strength with zero attrition rates is one of the most significant features of the department. The curriculum is periodically revised and updated to keep in pace with the upswing in the technological trends. The Department commenced to offer its first M.Tech degree programme in the year 1990, with the sponsorship of the AICTE, on Electronics and Communication Engineering with special emphasis on Telematics for Communication Engineering. A new M.Tech degree programme on Wireless Communication Technologies was started by the department in the year 2006. Over the years, the Department has matured into a proficient research centre. Ph.D programmes are being offered in the frontier areas of technology and cachet research findings are being published by the faculty and the students all through the year.",
