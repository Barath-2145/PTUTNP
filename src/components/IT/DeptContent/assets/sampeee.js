      "Introduction": "The Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering was started in the year 1993. Currently, it offers a B.Tech. programme in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, an M.Tech. programme in Electrical Drives and Control and Ph.D. programmes in nearly all specializations of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The department is well supported by both human resource and infrastructure. The curriculum and syllabi are designed to meet global technical challenges. On the rolls there are 19 highly qualified faculty members with 16 doctoral degree holders and 12 technically qualified members trained on specific skill sets to support the academic and research activities such as teaching, training, research & developments and testing & consultancy. All the labs are well equipped with the state of art equipments and the best-of-breed infrastructure for laboratory practice and specialized equipments for research. A wide spectrum of research activity is in progress and supported with good number of research papers being published every year. Therefore, the students of the department have the unique opportunity of working in a research environment. Alumni of the Department occupy high positions in Industry and academia across the globe. Numerous activities for students both co-curricular and extra-curricular take place round the year under the EEE Student council.",
